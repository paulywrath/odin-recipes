<h2>Description</h2>

<p>There's a reason so many restaurants put risotto on 
their menus: It's not a dish most people attempt to cook at 
home. Risotto has an earned reputation for being fussy. 
This easy risotto recipe requires a attention and stirring, 
but at its core, it's really just rice and broth. And when 
those two simple ingredients come together, they create a 
creamy, almost magical dish that's well worth the effort.
</p>

<p>With a solid formula, like the one below, you'll be able 
to tackle any risotto recipe and have a gorgeous meal on 
the table in about 30 minutes.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>32 ounces unsalted chicken stock, warmed 
    (you can also substitute vegetable broth or stock)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
    or Pecorino-Romano cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Bring stock to a simmer in a saucepan over medium. 
    Reduce heat and keep warm.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter and heat the oil in a large skillet 
    or wide-bottomed pot. Add the rice; stir to coat all the 
    grains, 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add 1 ladle of broth (½ cup to ¾ cup), stir, and 
    leave it alone until broth is nearly absorbed, 2 to 3 
    minutes. (Run a wooden spoon through it; rice should 
    slowly fill in the channel.)</li>
    <li>Stir, add another ladle of broth, and stir again. 
    Cook undisturbed until the broth is absorbed, 3 minutes. 
    Repeat until about 1 ladle of broth remains, 15 to 18 
    minutes of total cook time for the rice. Turn off heat.</li>
    <li>Add salt, remaining broth, and cheese. Stir gently 
    for 2 minutes. Serve immediately in warmed bowls, with 
    more grated cheese over top, if desired.</li>
